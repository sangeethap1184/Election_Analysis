# Election_Analysis

Overview of Election Audit:
  	The dataset, election_results.csv, that is given for this project consists of a number for the ballot ID and a name for the county and candidate, respectively. In this project, our final python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run to complete the audit:
•	Calculate the Total number of votes
•	Compile a list of candidates who received votes
•	Calculate the Total number of votes each candidate won
•	Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
•	The winner of the election based on popular vote
•	Calculate the total number and percentage of votes
•	Determine the county with largest turnout
Election-Audit Results
•	How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
369,711 votes were cast in this congressional election.
•	Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct

•	Which county had the largest number of votes?
Denver had 306,055 the largest number of votes
•	Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
Charles Casper Stockham has received 85,213 votes, which is 23.0% of the total votes that were cast in this congressional Election. Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes, which is 73.8% of the total votes that were cast in this congressional election. Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 which is 3.1% of the total votes that were cast in this congressional election.
•	Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
Diana DeGette, who received 272,896 votes which is 73.8% of the total votes, won the election.
Election-Audit Summary:
  This script can me modified for different future purposes by having it run multiple tasks to get a deeper understanding if someone was a campaign manager for a candidate. 
The first example is that we could look into cities and not just counties. Determining if a candidate will the winner of the election. Obviously, we would have to gather this data and input it into our election_results.csv file then basically do the same concept as we did for our counties part in this script.
 The second example on how we can continue and modify this script for future use is that we can see demographics among the different candidates. Age, sex, and ethnicity are three that are significant and in the interest of the candidates to understand which group they need to appeal to more. As stated before, we need to add these inputs into the election_results.csv file in order to begin the script for it. These two examples can be used for future purposes for candidates to see how to win a future election.
